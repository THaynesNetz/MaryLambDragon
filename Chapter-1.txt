Mary had a little lamb, who's fleece was white as snow.

Everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to follow. 

There was also a dragon. It was problematic, honestly.

The dragon was hungry, so in the night it stole the lamb.

With it's wings it flew away! It was gone before anyone saw.

May was sad. She swore a blood oath of vengance and dawned her armor.
